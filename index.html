            <p>
                It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad
                Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?
                It's just a cigarette like you always used to do
                I was different then, I don't need them to be cool
                It's just a cigarette and it harms your pretty lungs
                Well, it's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance
                It's just a cigarette, it'll soon be only ten
                Honey, can't you trust me when I want to stop, I can
                It's just a cigarette and it's just a Malboro Light
                Maybe but is it worth it if we fight?
                It's just a cigarette that I got from Jamie-Lee
                Oh, she's gonna get a smack and I'm gonna give you three
                It's just a cigarette and I only did it once (it's just a cigarette it'll soon be only ten)
                It's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance (it'll make you sick girl there's not
                much of
                a chance)
                It's just a cigarette and I'm sorry that I did it (it's just a cigarette, you'll be sorry that
                you
                did it)
                Honey, can't you trust me when I want to stop, I can
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la
                La la, la-la-la-la-la-la</p>
